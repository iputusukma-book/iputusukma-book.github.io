## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
------

* That in an efficient market, prices <u>reflect</u> all available <u>information</u>.
* Notice that the <u>level or degree or form</u> of market efficiency would depend on two dimensions:
  * Which information is available i.e. <u>the type</u> of information incorporated into price.
  * How fast information is reflected i.e. <u>the speed</u> with which new information is  incorporated into price.
* The seminal paper influencing EMH is [Fama (1970](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486) with the main proposition is that markets were extremely efficient at incorporating information into security prices.
* The core tenets of EMH were:
  * **Rapid information incorporation** -  The market was seen as extremely efficient at reflecting new information. When news becomes available, it spreads very quickly and is incorporated into security prices without delay.
  * **The ineffectiveness of analysis** - As a direct consequence of this rapid information processing, neither technical analysis (studying past prices) nor fundamental analysis (analysing company financials to find "undervalued" stocks) would allow an investor to earn returns greater than those from holding a randomly selected portfolio of comparable risk.
