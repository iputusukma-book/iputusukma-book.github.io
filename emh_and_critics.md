## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
------
### Overview of EMH

* That in an efficient market, prices <u>reflect</u> all available <u>information</u>.
* Notice that the <u>level or degree or form</u> of market efficiency would depend on two dimensions:
  * Which information is available i.e. <u>the type</u> of information incorporated into price.
  * How fast information is reflected i.e. <u>the speed</u> with which new information is  incorporated into price.
* The seminal paper influencing EMH is [Fama (1970)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486) with the main proposition is that markets were extremely efficient at incorporating information into security prices.
* The core tenets of EMH were:
  * **Rapid information incorporation** -  The market was seen as extremely efficient at reflecting new information. When news becomes available, it spreads very quickly and is incorporated into security prices without delay. This core tenet is strongly connected with the assumption of <u>rational investors</u> who can correctly interpreat and trade accordingly based on information. 
  * **The ineffectiveness of analysis** - As a direct consequence of this rapid information processing, neither technical analysis (studying past prices) nor fundamental analysis (analyzing company financials to find "undervalued" stocks i.e., stocks with higher intrinsic value relative to its price) would allow an investor to earn returns greater than those from holding a randomly selected portfolio of comparable risk.
* Then why are we interested in market efficiency? The answer would be related to several consequences:
  * If market prices at a given date only reflect a particular type of information, then one can profit by trading based on information relevant for pricing but not yet reflected in prices.
  * To assess the level of market efficiency need to know the securities' value,  which requires knowing how securities are priced. This make rise on the <u>joint-test problem<u/> in the empirical test of EMH.
  * **Joint-test problem** assert that market Efficiency per se is not testable because the question whether price reflects a given piece of information always depends on the model of asset pricing that the researcher is using.  It is always a joint test of market efficiency and the used pricing model ([Fama, 1970](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486) and [Fama (1991)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1991.tb04636.x)).
  * Despite the joint-test problem, tests of market efficiency, i.e., scientific search for inefficiencies, improves our understanding of the behavior of returns across time and securities. It helps to improve existing asset pricing models and the view and practices of financial-markets professionals.
* The link to <u>random walk</u>: [Malkiel (2003)](https://www.princeton.edu/~ceps/workingpapers/91malkiel.pdf) mentioned the association between EMH and random walk - a term that loosely used in the finance literature to characterize a price series where all subsequent price changes represent random departures from previous prices. If information flows freely and is immediately reflected in stock prices, then tomorrow’s price change will only reflect tomorrow’s news. By definition, news is unpredictable, hence, the resulting price changes must also be unpredictable and random. This leads to the conclusion that prices "fully reflect all known information," meaning even an uninformed investor could get a fair return - as that achieved by the experts - by buying a diversified portfolio.

### Type of Market Efficiency

| Form of Efficiency     | Information Reflected in Price             | Implication for Investors                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Weak-form**   | All information contained in **market trading data** (past prices, volume, dividends, interest rates, etc.)| Technical Analysis (using past price patterns) cannot consistently generate abnormal returns. Future price changes are random and driven by new information.|
| **Semi-strong-form**    |All **publicly available** information (including past market data, financial statements, news, press releases, etc.).|  information (including past market data, financial statements, news, press releases, etc.).	Fundamental Analysis (using public information about a company's value) cannot consistently generate abnormal returns. Only investors with non-public (private or inside) information could potentially gain an advantage.|
| **Strong-form**    |All information, **both public and private** (including inside or confidential information).|No investor, not even company insiders, can consistently generate abnormal returns, as all relevant information is already priced into the security.|

<u>Type of stock analysis</u>
> **Technical analysis**  — Refers to the practice of using past patterns in stock prices
(and trades) to identify future patterns in prices.
> **Fundamental analysis**  — Refers to the practice of using financial statements, announcements, and other publicly available information about firms to pick stocks.



### Investor Rationality and Efficient Market

The traditional EMH as formulated by Eugene Fama is built on a foundation that implies rational behaviour, particularly the concept of rapid information processing and the random walk. However, this view are opposed by scholars based on the argumentation that nvestors are often not rational, and this irrationality leads to market inefficiencies and predictable patterns.
* **Psychological Biases** — Behaviouralists argue that investors are subject to "waves of optimism and pessimism", overconfidence, and "bandwagon effects". This irrational behaviour causes prices of an asset to deviate systematically from their fundamental values.
• **Exploitable Patterns** — These critics believe that the actions of irrational investors create predictable patterns, such as long-run return reversals or the outperformance of "value" stocks, which can be exploited to earn excess returns. This directly contradicts the idea of an efficient market. Events like the October 1987 crash and the Internet bubble are often cited as overwhelming evidence that irrational investor behaviour can dominate the market.

[Malkiel (2003)](https://www.princeton.edu/~ceps/workingpapers/91malkiel.pdf) defends a more nuanced and pragmatic definition of market efficiency that does not require all investors to be rational.
* **Efficiency Defined as "No Free Lunch** — Malkiel defines an efficient market as one that does not allow investors to earn above-average returns without accepting above-average risks. This is the "no $100 bills lying on the ground" principle.
* **Irrationality is Permitted** — Under this definition, a market can still be efficient even if many market participants are quite irrational. It can also be efficient even if it makes egregious mistakes in valuation, as occurred during the  bubble period.
* **The Role of Arbitrage** — The reason efficiency can hold despite irrationality is that any truly repetitive and exploitable pattern that arises from irrational behaviour will be discovered by rational professional investors and "arbitraged away". This process causes the profitable pattern to "self-destruct" once it becomes widely known. For example, the well-publicised "January effect" has since become undependable.
* Limits to Arbitrage** — However, there are limits to how effectively rational investors can correct irrational mispricing. During the bubble, even if rational investors believed stocks were overvalued, the risk of shorting them was enormous because "some greater fools may be willing to pay three times the stock’s value". Practical issues, such as the inability to borrow stock to short sell, can also prevent arbitrage.

### Critics on EMH

EMH faces several critics which is largely driven by two main groups: behavioral economists with their bevhavioral-psychological-based critics and econometrician with their statistical-based evidence of predictability as well as specific historical events indicating market participants irrationality.

* **The Behavioural and Psychological Critique** — This group of critics argues that psychological and behavioural elements are central to how stock prices are determined. They believe investors are not always rational and are subject to biases that cause prices to deviate from their fundamental values.  The key premises of this critique are:
  * <u>Investor Overreaction and Underreaction</u> — Critics argue that investors are prone to waves of optimism and pessimism. This can lead them to underreact to new information, causing short-term price momentum, or to overreact to past events, which leads to long-run "return reversals" where past losers outperform past winners. This is often attributed to investor overconfidence.
  * <u>Bandwagon Effects and Irrational Exuberance</u> — Rising stock prices can create a "bandwagon effect" where psychological contagion draws more investors into the market, leading to "irrational exuberance" and price bubbles, such as the one in the late 1990s described by Robert Shiller.
  * <u>Overpayment for "Growth" Stocks</u> — The tendency for "value" stocks (those with low price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios) to outperform "growth" stocks is seen as evidence that overconfident investors overpay for growth stories that subsequently fail to meet expectations.
    
* **The Econometric and Statistical Critique** — This group of critics argues that statistical analysis of historical data reveals predictable patterns in stock returns, which contradicts the random walk theory associated with the EMH. Their premises are based on several documented "anomalies" and patterns:
  * <u>Short-Term Momentum</u> — More recent studies have found that short-term serial correlations are not zero, showing "too many" successive price moves in the same direction. Some researchers even found that technical analysis patterns like "head and shoulders" may have modest predictive power.
  * <u>Long-Run Return Reversals</u> — Over longer periods, studies show evidence of negative serial correlation, where past performance is reversed. Fama and French (1988) found that 25 to 40 per cent of the variation in long-term returns could be predicted this way.
  * <u>Seasonal and Daily Patterns</u> — Critics point to predictable patterns tied to the calendar, such as the "January effect" (unusually high returns in early January, especially for small stocks) and day-of-the-week effects.
  * <u>Predictability from Valuation Metrics</u> — It is argued that valuation ratios for the market as a whole have considerable predictive power. Studies have shown that a high initial dividend yield or a low price-earnings (P/E) multiple for the market index has historically been followed by higher long-term returns, and vice-versa.
  * <u>Cross-Sectional Patterns</u> — Two of the strongest findings are:
    * **the size effect** which is the tendency over long periods for smaller-company stocks to generate larger returns than large-company stocks,
    * **the value effect** which ishe tendency for stocks with low price-to-book-value ratios to outperform stocks with high ratios.

* **Irrefutabl Cases of Market Irrationality** — Critics argue that certain historical events provide overwhelming evidence that markets can be dominated by irrationality and that prices can become disconnected from rational valuations. The main examples are:
  * <u>The Market Crash of October 1987</u> — Critics allege that the market lost about a third of its value with "essentially no change in the general economic environment," which they believe proves that psychological factors, not rational calculations, were the cause.
  * <u>The Internet Bubble</u> — It is widely believed by critics that the outlandish valuations of internet stocks in the late 1990s can only be explained by the behaviour of irrational investors.
  * <u>Specific Pricing Anomalies</u> — Critics point to clear, though often temporary, mispricings, such as the spin-off of Palm Pilot from 3-Com, see [Malkiel (2003)](https://www.princeton.edu/~ceps/workingpapers/91malkiel.pdf), where the market value of the subsidiary implied a negative value for the parent company's core business. Other examples include stock price co-movement due to ticker symbol confusion.
