## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
------
### Overview of EMH

* That in an efficient market, prices <u>reflect</u> all available <u>information</u>.
* Notice that the <u>level or degree or form</u> of market efficiency would depend on two dimensions:
  * Which information is available i.e. <u>the type</u> of information incorporated into price.
  * How fast information is reflected i.e. <u>the speed</u> with which new information is  incorporated into price.
* The seminal paper influencing EMH is [Fama (1970)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486) with the main proposition is that markets were extremely efficient at incorporating information into security prices.
* The core tenets of EMH were:
  * **Rapid information incorporation** -  The market was seen as extremely efficient at reflecting new information. When news becomes available, it spreads very quickly and is incorporated into security prices without delay. This core tenet is strongly connected with the assumption of <u>rational investors</u> who can correctly interpreat and trade accordingly based on information. 
  * **The ineffectiveness of analysis** - As a direct consequence of this rapid information processing, neither technical analysis (studying past prices) nor fundamental analysis (analyzing company financials to find "undervalued" stocks i.e., stocks with higher intrinsic value relative to its price) would allow an investor to earn returns greater than those from holding a randomly selected portfolio of comparable risk.
* Then why are we interested in market efficiency? The answer would be related to several consequences:
  * If market prices at a given date only reflect a particular type of information, then one can profit by trading based on information relevant for pricing but not yet reflected in prices.
  * To assess the level of market efficiency need to know the securities' value,  which requires knowing how securities are priced. This make rise on the <u>joint-test problem<u/> in the empirical test of EMH.
  * **Joint-test problem** assert that market Efficiency per se is not testable because the question whether price reflects a given piece of information always depends on the model of asset pricing that the researcher is using.  It is always a joint test of market efficiency and the used pricing model ([Fama, 1970](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486) and [Fama (1991)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1991.tb04636.x)).
  * Despite the joint-test problem, tests of market efficiency, i.e., scientific search for inefficiencies, improves our understanding of the behavior of returns across time and securities. It helps to improve existing asset pricing models and the view and practices of financial-markets professionals.
* The link <u>random walk</u>: [Malkiel (2003)](https://www.princeton.edu/~ceps/workingpapers/91malkiel.pdf) mentioned the association between EMH and random walk - a term that loosely used in the finance literature to characterize a price series where all subsequent price changes represent random departures from previous prices. If information flows freely and is immediately reflected in stock prices, then tomorrow’s price change will only reflect tomorrow’s news. By definition, news is unpredictable, hence, the resulting price changes must also be unpredictable and random. This leads to the conclusion that prices "fully reflect all known information," meaning even an uninformed investor could get a fair return - as that achieved by the experts - by buying a diversified portfolio.

### Critics on EMH

EMH faces several critics which is largely driven by two main groups: behavioral economists with their bevhavioral-psychological-based critics and econometrician with their statistical-based evidence of predictability as well as specific historical events indicating market participants irrationality.
