## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
------

* That in an efficient market, prices <u>reflect</u> all available <u>information</u>.
* Notice that the <u>level or degree or form<u> of market efficiency would depend on two dimensions:
  * Which information is <u>available</u> i.e. the type of information incorporated into price.
  * How fast information is <u>reflected</U> i.e. the speed with which new information is  incorporated into price.
