### Brief Introduction to Research

#### Research Process: Theoretical and Empirical Task

*   Research is often viewed as a process that comprised of theoretical tasks and empirical tasks.
*   All research, regardless the discipline, requires activities at conceptual level (or so-called theoretical studies)
*   <u>Examples of empirical tasks:</u> data collection, constructing questionnaires, data analysis using computers.
*   <u>Examples of theoretical tasks:</u> finding and constructing a precise problem, developing perspectives or models to represent the problem under scrutiny


#### Research Process: Research and Knowledge

*   Albeit not its primary, one of the main purpose of research is to produce insights or knowledge.
*   Knwowledge can be in the form of theories, models, concepts, methods/techniques, facts, and practical implications.
*   The important point is that any research should have an intended contributions: to bring or add something new/novel.
*   Even though some extent of waiver could be given to undergraduate level –  replication of previous research – contribution could still be produced. <u>For instance by providing different settings (time period, market, industry, sector) in such a replication study</u>.

#### Research Process: On what comes first: theory or research

*   On “what comes first: theory or research”:
    *   The context of discovery: concern on the situation where an item of knowledge is disovered or hypothesized. How a knowledge is learnt.
    *   The context of justification: concern on the situation where the knowledge is justified or verified. How a knowledge is established as reliable

*   Example: Louis Bachelier in 1900 postulated that stock price movement is following a Brownian motion i.e., random walk. The following study, for instance: efficient market hypothesis, justified the random walk postulate through observation and experiment

#### Concepts, Definitions, Theory, & Methods

*   Concepts:
    *   The building blocks of any theory or model. The abstraction representing an object, the property of an object or a certain phenomenon.
    *   The foundation of communication of certain object and idea.
    *   Introduce perspective, a way of viewing certain object at the empirical world
    *   Example: return, price, value, cost, income, liquidity, time value of money, financial risk, depreciation
      
*   Definitions:
    *   The clarification and precision of concepts are achieved through definitions.
    *   Conceptual Definitions (commonly in Chapter 2 Literature Review of our research paper) vs Operational Definitions (commonly in Chapter 3 Methodology of our research paper)
    *   Conceptual definitions: definitions that describe concepts using other concepts. Point out unique attributes of the concepts.  Example: stock market is an exchange where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell equity stock.
    *   Operational definitions: a set of procedures describing the activities to be performed to empirically. Example: stock market size is the total market capitalization which is the market aggregate of multiplication of number of stock outstanding and market price of stock traded.
 
*   Theory:
    *   A system for ordering concepts in a way that produces understanding or insights.
    *   A set of interrelated concepts, definitions, and propositions that present a systematic view of specifying relations among variables with the purpose of explaining and predicting phenomena
    *   Limiting the focus on specific aspects of the phenomena studied i.e., several aspects would be left out due to limitation of human cognitive capacity.
    *   Example: Miller Modigliani Theorem (capital structure irrelevance), Malkiel Theorem (term structure of interest rate), Modern Portfolio Theory (mean-variance model).
      
*   Method: 
    *   The rules and procedures to solve the problems.
    *   Should be logic (ways of reasoning to arrive at conclusion), communicating (convey the findings), and intersubjective (outsiders able to examine and evaluate the findings)
    *   Good research problems + underlying theory, means good method

#### Type of Research

*   According to its purpose: 
    *   Theoretical research that focus on knowledge discovery
    *   Applied research that focus on justification of certain theory
*   According to the depth of scope: 
    *   Exploratory: commonly a preliminary investigation of a subject not well understood
    *   Descriptive: defining characteristics of certain phenomena
    *   Correlational: observing the relationship between variables
*   According to type of data: 
    *   Qualitative: linguistic, semiotic
    *   Quantitative: numeric 
*   According to the degree of manipulation of the variables: 
    *  Experimental: strictly controlled, proper type of research to observed causality
    *  Non-experimental: leave the object as natural phenomena
    *  Quasi-experimental: focus group, environment is not fully controlled
*   According to the type of inference: 
    *  Deductive: explain reality based on certain theory and reserach problem
    *  Inductive: develop new theory from observed data
    *  Hypothetical inductive: create hypothesis from observation of reality and then use that as deduction to obtain conclusion
*   According to the time in which the research is carried out: 
    *   Longitudinal: across time
    *   Cross sectional: in a single time
*   According to the source of information: 
    *   Primary
    *   Secondary
*   According to how the data is obtained: 
    *   Documentary
    *   Field research
    *   Laboratory
    *   Mixed
